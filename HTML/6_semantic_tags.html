    <!--  <header>   -->   <!--  aside-->
    <!--  <article>  -->

        <!-- these helps to rank the web in search engine  -->
        <!-- what is the use?   now div and span and other they dont explain us where to be used but these semantic elements help to know that which part of the code is used for what and where will it be its position. -->
